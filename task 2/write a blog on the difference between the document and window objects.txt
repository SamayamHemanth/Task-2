Document object: We can access the elements in the html by accessing the document object with the help of this we 
can add dynamic content to our web page.It can be accessed with a window.document or just document.

Syntax:
        document.propertyname;

properties of document objects that are used like body,activeElement,domain,doctype, etc...


Window object: Window object represents a browser window or frame that displays the contents of the webpage.It is one
               of the most important object in the Document Object Model (DOM) hierarchy.

Syntax:
        window.propertyname;

properties of window objects that are used like closed,customElements,frames,Length, etc...


Difference between document and window objects:



Document object : * Document represents any HTML document or web page that is loaded in the browser.
 
                  * It is loaded inside the window.

                  * It is the object of the window property.

                  * Elements and tags with all attributes in the HTML are part of the document.

                  * Document access can done from a window using the window.document.

                  * The document is a part of BOM(Browser Object Model) and DOM(Document Object Model).

                  * properties of the document object such as title,body,cookies,etc.. can also be accessed by a
                    window like this window.document.title.

                  * syntax: document.propertyname;

                  * Example: document.title - it will return the title of the document.



Window Object: * Window represents a browser window or frame that displays the contents of the webpage.

               * Window is the first object that is loaded in the browser.
            
               * It is the object of the browser.

               * Members of the window object are Global objects,functions and variables of the javascript.

               * Window access can be done only from the window. i.e. window.window .

               * It a part of BOM(Browser Object Model) and not a part of DOM(Document Object Model).

               * window object properties can not be accessed by the document object such as innerHeight,frames,innerWidth,
                 Length,Navigator, Name, etc...

               * Syntax: window.propertyname;

               * Example: Window.innerHeight - It will return the height of the content area of the browser.
